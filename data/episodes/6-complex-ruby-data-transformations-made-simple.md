I often work with hashes in plain ruby, especially when I prepare **standalone scripts or gem packages**, or [I need to deserialize the parameters comming to the server](/episodes/7-untangle-your-app-with-dry-monads), and there were plenty of situations where I needed to do some simple, or more complex data transformations to achieve the expected output.

In the *episode #4* I've described [how I easily do fancy manipulations on string objects](/episodes/4-string-transformations-with-dry-inflector), but, more complex data sets require more powerful tricks to serve our needs so I've decided to extend this topic.

### Troubles with data transformations - symbolize keys

One example of troublesome hash, is when I get the hash as a method argument, but **I don't know if the keys are symbols or strings**. Then things can get messy.

```ruby
def deserialize(hash)
   hash[:data]
end

deserialize({ 'data' => 'bad luck!' })
# => nil
```

Because the expected key does not exist, I receive `nil` and I can easily end up with the *undefined method* error which may be an embarrassing overlook for me in the eyes of my clients.

#### Custom hash stringifiers

In rails, you can just call `symbolize_keys` or `deep_symbolize_keys` on the given hash and the problem would be solved. This would work on any deep level of my argument.

```ruby
# in rails

def deserialize(hash)
   hash.deep_symbolize_keys[:data]
end

deserialize({ 'data' => 'good luck!' })
# => 'good luck'
```

But how it would look like outside of the Rails ecosystem? The `deep_symbolize_keys` method is not defined in plain ruby.

Here is the simplified solution I used in the past all the time using the `each_with_object` method.

```ruby
hash = {
  'visitor' => 'John',
  'city' => 'NY',
  'zip' => '1234'
}
hash.each_with_object({}) { |(k, v), r| r[k.to_sym] = v }
# => { visitor: 'John', city: 'NY', zip: '1234' }
```

Horrible, but works for plain hashes. However, since ruby 2.5 we have access to the `transform_keys` method, which is way more convenient.

```ruby
hash = {
  'visitor' => 'John',
  'city' => 'NY',
  'zip' => '1234'
}
hash.transform_keys(&:to_s)
# => { 'visitor' => 'John', 'city' => 'NY', 'zip' => '1234' }
```

While this looks fine, **none of this will take into account nested hashes**. If I'd want to solve THIS problem, things would quickly get messy, and in case of more transformations required on the data set, I would quickly get lost in my own code.

>Note: As [thunderbong](https://www.reddit.com/user/thunderbong/) [pointed out on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/ogu1lu/6_complex_ruby_transformations_made_simple_with/), there is a nice way to handle nested key transformations easily using `JSON` library.

```ruby
require 'json'

hash = {
  'name' =>
  'Mr. Smith',
  'address' => { 'city' => 'Sim City', 'zip' => 123456 }
}

JSON.parse(JSON[hash], symbolize_names: true)
# => { :name=>"Mr. Smith", :address => { :city => "Sim City", :zip => 123456 } }
```

Just it's not trivial to remember about all the edge cases of the data transformations..

### Nest keys

The other very simple example would be to** nest a set of keys** under a chosen parent.  If I store the address information as a `jsonb` in my database, I'd be forced to group the address-related keys and store them together under the `address` column.

Again, the `each_with_object` method would come in handy here.

```ruby
def nest(hash)
  hash.each_with_object({}) do |(k, v), r|
    if %i[city zip].include?(k.to_sym)
      r[:address] ||= {}
      r[:address][k] = v
    else
      r[k] = v
    end
  end
end

hash = { visitor: 'John', city: 'NY', zip: '1234' }
nest(hash)
# => { visitor: 'John', address: { city: 'NY', zip: '1234' } }
```

I can iterate through the initial hash, and in case the key is inside of the given set, nest it under the `address` root, and otherwise just copy the initial value.

If you think it works, You're wrong. It works for symbolized keys, but if I'll pass the same hash with strings as keys,** the original hash will be returned**. Easy to fix? Just let's change the key comparison here to ensure the compared value is a symbol...

And **we end up with a completely messed hash as a result!**

What I want to point out here, is the fact that ensuring data to be transformed expectedly **is not trivial**, and it's extremely easy to overlook a single scenario that can haunt us later.

It's already hard to see what's happening here, and again, if there would be **several transformations like this required** on the given data set, my code would become really messy and hard to handle.

Just imagine that I'd need to stringify and rename some keys too!

### Meet dry-transformer

This is where a great little gem comes with help. It's a [dry-transformer](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-transformer), another amazing micro-library put together by [Piotr Solnica](https://github.com/solnic), it is great as it has completely no dependencies whatsoever! You can inject it in your projects without any risk - and in case you want to have it directly in your codebase, you can even just copy the code,** as only plain ruby is used inside**. Amazing stuff.

This little library allows you to pass any data as an input and do some crazy transformations to ensure you will work with the expected data format.

#### Ok, but How that could be handy?

Well, one example is, that in HanamiMastery I work with [JSON:API standard](https://jsonapi.org/) when it comes to my API communication. It's super nice, REST-ful standard, with a lot of overhead already done by very smart people.

However, when I want to make my projects to communicate with, for example, GitHub, it would not work, as GitHub uses the Rest API standard, which is Rails default.

![Communication troubles](/images/episodes/6/adapters-1.png)

It would be silly to ask them to adjust their API for my needs;)

![How not to communicate](/images/episodes/6/adapters-2.png)

What I should do, is transform the incoming data from one standard to another relatively easily and ideally, do the two-way transformations!

![Why we need adapters](/images/episodes/6/adapters-3.png)

#### Other useful examples for data transformations in Ruby

Similar requirements are often needed in case of:
- CSV exports or imports,
- RSS parsing,
- user input
- code highlighting
- markdown files

and so on. There are countless use cases, where I can't just validate the input and throw away an error because data are valid, however in a different format than my script or data store expect.

In such scenarios, I should write an adapter that applies a list of transformations to the input and produces the output I can work with.

With `dry-transformer` our simple examples would be trivial. We create our adapter class, that gets the data from Github

```ruby
class HanamiMasteryAdapter < Dry::Transformer::Pipe
  import Dry::Transformer::HashTransformations

  define! do
    deep_symbolize_keys
    nest :address, %i[city zip]
    rename_keys login: :name
  end
end

hash = {
  'id' => 1
  'login' => 'John',
  'city' => 'NY',
  'zip' => { 'number' => 1234 }
}
adapter.call(hash)
# => { id: name: 'John', address: { city: 'NY', zip: { number: 1234 } } }
```

But also, **some much more complex scenarios** may be done in a simple, easy to read and maintain code.

### Summary

`dry-transformer` allows you to** write middleware for your APIs with no effort**, you can do mappings from hash to objects and other ways around, advanced array modifications, and a whole bunch of other stuff you would ever need.

As I often say, the only thing that restricts us is our imagination and `dry-transformer` **allows you to transform anything into anything else** using a tiny DSL written on top of ruby.

Super useful stuff and I strongly suggest giving it a shot. You may be surprised how easily you can write adapters, serializers, and deserializers from now on.
